  ### Problem Statement 
- The primary objective of this project is to analyze tweets from various individuals and discern their sentiments, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral.

### Approach 
- To ascertain the sentiment of tweets, I employed the bag of words model commonly used in Natural Language Processing. The preprocessing involved eliminating irrelevant words and stemming the tweets to their base forms. Following data cleansing, the model underwent training using various classification models to determine its predictive accuracy.

### Libraries Used 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
